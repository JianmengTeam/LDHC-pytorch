# LDHC-PyTorch
  This work is  the Pytorch implementation for our PR 2024 paper:  
  > Pattern Recognition 2024. Meng Jian, Langchen Lang, Jingjing Guo, Zun Li, Tuo Wang, Lifang Wu. Light Dual Hypergraph Convolution for Collaborative Filtering.  
# Introduction
  LDHC builds a two-level interest propagation within the heterogeneous interaction graph and between the homogeneous user/item graphs. Interest propagation is constructed with a light hypergraph convolution to model usersâ€™ interests.  
# Environment
 We implement the proposed LDHC model and all the comparisons with PyTorch 1.13 and Python 3.8.
# Dataset
  We provide dataset: MovieLens-1M.
