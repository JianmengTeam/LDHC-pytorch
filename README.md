# LDHC-pytorch
This work is  the Pytorch implementation for our PR 2024 paper:
> Pattern Recognition 2024. Meng Jian, Langchen Lang, Jingjing Guo, Zun Li, Tuo Wang, Lifang Wu. Light Dual Hypergraph Convolution for Collaborative Filtering. 

# Introduction
LDHC builds a two-level interest propagation within the heterogeneous interaction graph and between the homogeneous user/item graphs. Interest propagation is constructed with a light hypergraph
convolution to model usersâ€™ interests.

# Dataset
We provide dataset: MovieLens-1M.
